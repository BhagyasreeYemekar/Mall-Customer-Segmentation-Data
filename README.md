Mall Customer Segmentation

This project applies data cleaning, preprocessing, and customer segmentation techniques to a retail dataset of mall customers. The goal is to understand customer spending behavior, group them into meaningful clusters, and generate insights that can guide targeted marketing strategies.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Mall Customer Segmentation Data.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook with end-to-end analysis
Mall_Customers(1).xls â†’ Original dataset
Mall_Customers_cleaned.csv â†’ Cleaned dataset ready for analysis

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Standardized column names and removed duplicates
Handled missing values using median (numeric) and mode (categorical)
Normalized categorical values (e.g., gender)
Converted numeric-like text columns into numeric types

ðŸ“Š Analysis Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Univariate & bivariate visualizations of income, spending score, and age distribution
Segmentation: Applied clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group customers based on income and spending behavior
Visualization: Used scatter plots, heatmaps, and cluster charts to highlight patterns

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
Customers naturally group into distinct segments based on income vs. spending score
Identified high-value clusters (e.g., high income & high spenders) suitable for loyalty programs
Found budget-conscious groups (low income & low spenders) requiring different marketing strategies

ðŸš€ Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for reproducible analysis

ðŸ“ˆ Applications
Targeted marketing campaigns
Personalized promotions for different customer groups
Strategic decision-making in retail and e-commerce
